autodetect auto wiring is deprecated.
autowiring by constructor works by type.

However, I noticed that if ambiguity can't be resolved by type, but by name - spring does that 
as in below case. Here booth fileWriter and consoleWriter are of type ILogger.


private ILogWriter consoleWriter;
private ILogWriter fileWriter;

	public Logger(ILogWriter consoleWriter,
			ILogWriter fileWriter) {
		this.consoleWriter = consoleWriter;
		this.fileWriter = fileWriter;
	}


	<bean id="logger" class="Logger" autowire="constructor">
	</bean>

	<bean id="fileWriter" class="FileWriter"></bean>
	<bean id="consoleWriter" class="ConsoleWriter" init-method="anotherInit"></bean>
