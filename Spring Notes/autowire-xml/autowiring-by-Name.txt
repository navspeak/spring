In our logger class two beans that we want to wire have same type (as we have setters that accept common Interface

public class Logger {
	private ILogWriter consoleWriter;
	private ILogWriter fileWriter;

	public void setConsoleWriter(ILogWriter writer) {
		this.consoleWriter = writer;
	}

	public void setFileWriter(ILogWriter fileWriter) {
		this.fileWriter = fileWriter;
	}
}

Hence, autowiring by type will fail.
In such case you could autowire by name (match by id not name. see the camel case)
Change fileWriter to FileWriter and see that in Logger bean setFileWriter setter will set null.

	<bean id="logger" class="Logger" autowire="byName">
	</bean>

	<bean id="fileWriter" class="FileWriter"></bean>
	<bean id="consoleWriter" class="ConsoleWriter" init-method="anotherInit"></bean>
